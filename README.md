# Getting Started with Open Source

Many persons trying to break out into the open source space still find it overwhelming. This project aims to give an essential starter guide to making your first open source contribution.
**OSS** stands for _Open Source Software_. This type of software has freely accessible source code under a license that lets you examine, modify, and use that code without restriction.
[Here is an article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-open-source-software/) that gives an in-depth explanation of [Open Source Software](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-open-source-software/).
